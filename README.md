# Terrorism Dashboard Analysis using Power BI

## Overview

The project involves the creation of a dashboard using Power BI to analyze terrorism-related data. This dashboard allows users to explore various aspects of terrorism incidents, including where they occur, the types of attacks, the number of casualties, and how these incidents have evolved over time.

By visualizing the data in an interactive and intuitive manner, users can gain insights into patterns, trends, and hotspots related to terrorism. They can filter the data based on different parameters such as location, time period, or attack type, enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics.

Overall, the goal of the project is to provide a powerful tool for policymakers, analysts, and researchers to better understand terrorism trends and inform decision-making regarding counter-terrorism strategies.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Explore terrorism data through interactive charts, maps, and graphs.
- **Geographical Analysis:** Visualize terrorism incidents on a map to understand their geographical distribution.
- **Temporal Trends:** Analyze temporal trends and patterns in terrorism incidents over time.
- **Attack Types:** Explore different types of terrorist attacks and their frequency.
- **Casualty Analysis:** Understand the impact of terrorism by analyzing casualties and fatalities.
- **Data Filtering:** Filter data based on various parameters such as location, time period, attack type, and more.
- **Drill-down Capability:** Drill down into specific regions or categories for detailed analysis.

## Usage
